Depending on the outside context, two seemingly opposite cases may actually be correct.

We can only decide at a local scope


=====

how to handle:

I) Keep `if (cond): raise(err)` only.
= throw away code before and after the raise

if isinstance(st,epg.state):
    return st
else:
    raise TypeError('state is not state')
    return None

a)
add not to the condition and keep cond + 

...


`if (cond1): block1()
elif (cond2): block2()
elif (cond3): block3()
else: block4()`

case 3:
	block3() == raise(err3)

	if (not cond1 and not cond2 and cond3): block3()

case 4:
	block4() == raise(err4)

	if (not cond 1 and not cond2 and not cond3): block4()
