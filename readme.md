# Detecting IF-Inconsistencies
tl;dr I used an LSTM to classify if-condition-statement code blocks as consistent/inconsistent (think erroneous).

Using a provided codebase, I parsed the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), extracted if-condition-statements, and transformed them into a dataset. Creating inconsistent but plausible synthetic data for training was an interesting problem to tackle here (see slides for more). I trained a neural network (bi-directional single-layer LSTM with a classifier head) to classify the statements as consistent or inconsistent (containing a bug or a typo). The solution reached an 87.4% accuracy in the synthetic dataset, but the performance did not generalize to real test cases (outside the dataset).
In this project, I used: Python, Pytorch, Huggingface, Numpy, Pandas, LibCST, Scikit-Learn, Weights&Biases, a FastText tokenizer, and maybe a few other toys.
This project was developed in the "Analysing Software with Deep Learning" course at Universit√§t Stuttgart as a solo project under the supervision of Islem Bouzenia.
